    <h3>Tasty Pan Fried Pork Chops</h3>
    <p>Okay, people. Let’s get down to business here. Let’s get down to basics, let’s get down to brass tacks, let’s get
        down to the nitty gritty...Let’s fry up some pork chops.</p>
    <p>If you think this isn’t Marlboro Man’s idea of a perfect family meal (there’s an iceberg wedge with ranch
        dressing over to the side), then…you don’t know Marlboro Man. Pepper, seasoning…tons of surface area in relation
        to the meat inside. That means flavor, baby. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>7 pieces or 8 pieces breakfast chops (very thin bone-in pork chops)</li>
        <li>1 c. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp. seasoned salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp. black pepper</li>
        <li>Cayenne pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 c. canola oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. butter</li>
        <li>Extra salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse pork chops. (Yes, I rinse my pork chops. Please don’t be hatin’.) Salt and pepper both sides of the
            pork chops.</li>
        <li>Combine all dry ingredients. Dredge each side of the pork chops in the flour mixture, then set aside on a
            plate.</li>
        <li>Heat canola oil over medium to medium-high heat. Add butter. When butter is melted and butter/oil mixture is
            hot, cook 3 pork chops at a time, 2 to 3 minutes on the first side; 1 to 2 minutes on the other side. (Make
            sure no pink juices remain.) Remove to a plate and repeat with remaining pork chops. Delicious and simple!
            Serve with smashed new potatoes.</li>
    </ol>
